They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."]

If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met.

Other ways to talk about sadness might be feeling low, feeling down, or feeling blue.A person may say they are feeling depressed, but if it goes away on its own and doesn't impact life in a big way, it probably isn't the illness of depression. Depression is a mental illness that affects your mood, the way you understand yourself, and the way you understand and relate to things around you. It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life. It's a real illness, and it is very treatable. It's important to seek help if you're concerned about depression."

    "Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to \"snap out of it\" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC",

CBT helps with gaining a better awareness of how your thought process influences your belief system, and how your beliefs impact your actions and the outcome of your behaviors.  This process isn’t easy but it helps teach an individual that we don’t always have control over what happens in our lives but we can control how we interpret, feel, and behave.

Please know that even if you are feeling worthless right now, that doesn't mean you are worthless.The first step to working through this is recognizing what is going on. Recognizing when depression is telling you the same story (ie; being worthless) with different words (ie worthless here, worthless there) and making an effort to talk back. While I can not give you a diagnosis of depression, reading what you are going through, it sounds like you might need help to get back on track.

"Let me start by saying there are never too many concerns that you can bring into counselling. In fact, most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected. In counselling, we work together, collaboratively, to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care. Basically, it’s like a road map of where you want to go, how are you going to get there, looking at stopovers, some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic, however, necessary. Of course, these plans can also change due to internal (what we have control over like our thoughts, feelings and behaviours) or external reasons (those things that are outside our control). I would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional you can trust and build rapport with by co-journeying through whatever concerns you have by examining what has been working so far as you have learned to cope with some of your issues like insomnia, depression and anxiety, as well as being a breast cancer survivor. Then to help you by developing new coping strategies. Psychotherapy can be such a powerful tool to help you get to where it is you want to be.

Be sure to express to your counselor if any of the above experiences you've been through is causing a lot of distress , as many times the first things addressed are the ones that are presently affecting your life or you emotionally. Often times when we experience negative situations in our life , but do not address them, they bottle up inside us and can manifest in other ways, such as depression or even physical symptoms like IBS or neck pain.  Counseling can give these bottled up emotions and situations a release. Given the situation you shared, not only do I not think that you have too many issues for counseling, but believe that you will be a great candidate and can get a lot from it.",

"It could be really helpful to see a counselor/therapist about your increasing depression/panic symptoms. Finding out the cause of depression/anxiety isn't always as straightforward as it seems, since both issues tend to become patterns we engage in rather than solely related to a specific trigger/reason. For example, if I am feeling down about a particular circumstance in my life, then I start seeing life through this lens of feeling down, and typically I'll start to see a lot more that I get down about, and it can really build very quickly on itself. Same with anxiety. Obviously, this is a very simplified example and it can be very difficult to see how the patterns is maintained, but that's where working with a counselor/therapist comes in. I would be curious about whether you can start to notice the initial sensations of panic, and if you can (through the panic attack) continue to maintain awareness of the actual physical sensations. Even better if you can talk yourself through the sensations you're feeling - such as saying to yourself \"Okay, I'm breathing really rapidly, and my heart is racing, now my palms are sweaty and my chest is feeling really tight...\" Reminding yourself that it's just your body's reaction to stress, and while it might be overreacting right now, you're okay and eventually it will go away.

Meditation can reduce rumination and the break negative thought patterns by increasing your control over random unwanted thoughts and decreasing your tendency to worry by altering the way your brain responds to stress. For example, instead of following your negative thought down the rabbit hole, you learn to view your thoughts differently and recognize it for what it is – a thought – and let it go. Thank goodness to neuroplasticity and your brains endless capacity to change! Balances Brain ChemicalsAnxiety is brought on by various factors (personality type, emotional trauma, genes, prolonged exposure to stress…) and sometimes causes an imbalance of chemicals within the brain (GABA and serotonin). A meditation practice can assist in restoring the balance of neurotransmitters within the brain by increasing GABA (neurotransmitter connected to feeling happy and relaxed) and serotonin (another neurotransmitter connected to being happy) and decreasing cortisol (stress hormone).Builds A Healthier BrainBased on research and scans, individuals who have a regular meditation practice show dramatically larger amounts of gray matter, the volume of the hippocampus, thickness of the cortex, increased blood flow to the brain, improved neural connections between various parts of the brain and decreased size of the amygdala (controls autonomic responses associated with fear, arousal, and emotional stimulation). View full article here: https://www.therapybyshannon.com/blog-2/2019/4/16/meditate-to-lower-anxiety-levels",

How are you interpreting the events that are happening to you? Try to interpret them in a less negative way. Unfortunately we cannot stop our thoughts as our brain is always working. If you can't see your issues in a different way then stop struggling and allow and accept whatever the unhelpful thoughts are. Choose to take actions based on your values and what will give you a fulfilling life no matter what your thoughts are. Remember, your thoughts have no power unless you act upon them. Emotional: do not let feelings dictate your actions, even if something feels anxious take action again based on your values and how you want to live.   Social: connect with healthy friends and family that will be a positive support. Take up some hobbies and recreation activities as well. If things do not improve I would encourage you to make an appointment with a talk therapist and discuss these issues. I would encourage you to also be open to consider an evaluation for anti-depressants with these issues as well. If you ever feel like you might hurt yourself please call 911 or go to your nearest ER.",

You can do this by googling \"anxiety depression therapist \" in your city.  CounselChat also has a directory of amazing therapists, as does Psychology TodayMedication - Depending on what other symptoms you may be struggling with depends on what medication you will be prescribed. Be 100% honest with the doctor and ask about different side effects or potential risks associated with the medication. You more than likely will be prescribed an SSRI.Therapy & Medication - The outcomes are very good for those who decide to do both. Medication can help level out out your mood and therapy can help you process through your emotions and keep you accountable for you goals , as you will be seeing your therapist more often than your psychiatristTherapy & Homeopathy - Homeopathy could potentially be a good tool to use alongside with therapy in case you are not interested in going down the medication route. Arsenicum album is most commonly given to those who struggle with anxiety and depression.The choice is yours. My recommendation is to start with therapy and explore your options more in depth with your therapist.",
"First, be patient because anxiety and depression are rooted in a person's outlook on who they are and how they handle situations and relationships.Changing these deep major structures in your life takes time to try new ways and see what develops, then fine tune accordingly.Most commonly, anxiety and depression relate to one's self definition.Reflect on your own opinion of yourself and whether you'd like making any adjustments to this.   Then figure out what stops or inhibits you from doing this.Try new ways of thinking and interacting with other people.  The changed impression you make on others will influence your own view of who you are.In America people take Pharma pills to not feel badly.If you prefer to make natural, long-lasting change then reflect, read, try therapy if it feels right to you.Eventually you will be better off this way than to take drugs to hide how you truly feel."

Emotions can linger within us, and sometimes, even if the current moment seems calm, there could be unresolved feelings from the recent past that are still influencing your state of mind. Being aware of your sensitivity and your thoughts is a great step toward understanding your emotional journey.",
"One helpful suggestion is to start tracking small things that happen each day. This way, you can notice if something specific is affecting your mood, even if other things are overwhelming you. You could also try keeping a record of one positive moment from each day. When things are tough, you can look back at these moments to remind yourself of the good. It's also worth checking if your basic needs, like eating well and getting enough sleep, are being met, as these significantly impact your mood. Do you have support from friends or family? Can you spare a few minutes each day to do something you enjoy? Reflecting on past moments when you felt content can help you identify what contributed to those feelings. Lastly, try to be present in daily activities—whether it's eating a meal or completing a task—acknowledge your actions and give yourself a moment of appreciation for what you've accomplished.",
"It’s important to reflect on what's happening inside you that could be contributing to these feelings. If you'd like, please reach out to us in any way that feels comfortable for you, and we can connect you with someone who will help guide you through understanding these emotions and finding your way to a place of contentment."

I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to. What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?"
],
"responses": [
"First step always is to do a medical rule out so that you're sure the problem is psychological and emotion-based, not a medical condition which requires care and attention. If you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection, then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what you're doing with your life, or whether your wife has these sorts of problems within herself. Often a problem transfers ownership of who shows it. If you are a sensitive person, it's possible your erection problem reflects your wife's insecurities and self-doubt. If she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure, then in a certain way by you showing a problem, she can avoid looking at herself. Medicine looks for symptoms to treat, but our emotional lives are much more indirect. If you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live, for example, then your frustration may show up in your sex life. Do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the same. You may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away.",
"When I'm working with men in this type of situation, I always suggest a medical examination to rule out any type of organic reason for difficulty in maintaining an erection. In cases where there is no medical reason, I find that many men experience negative intrusive thinking during lovemaking. My counseling approach for this situation is to incorporate the use of mindful sex.",
"For starters, know that this is a normal experience for many men at some point in their lives. While this can certainly cause some embarrassment, diminished sexual esteem, or relationship problems, it is important to know you are not alone. Assuming you have already checked with a medical professional to rule out any medical problems, there are two primary reasons for this. One is a short-term biological shortage of blood flow to the penis, which can be caused by diet, lack of exercise, or stress. Another reason is anxiety. Are there recent relationship issues or feelings of dissatisfaction in the bedroom? These are just a few aspects that can lead to subconscious anxiety and loss of erection. My suggestion is to seek out a counselor specializing in sexuality to assist you.",
"Erection maintenance is caused by connective tissue weakness as well as lymphatic stagnation in the area. A proper detoxification is necessary to reverse the stagnation and get things flowing again. Lower circulation and pituitary issues might also be indicated. Medical treatments typically don't address the root cause and only suppress symptoms. Certain herbal and natural protocols would be beneficial for getting things going again.",
"If you haven't already, please see a doctor. ED can be caused by various physical conditions, so you need to get checked out. Once you've ruled out physical causes, it's time to look for more subtle reasons. You may have gotten into a mindset of 'I hope I can, but what if I can't?' which can interfere with performance. After ruling out physical causes, talk with your wife about working together to find the right approach. It might help to take the pressure off by enjoying each other without intercourse. You can have great sex without penetration and experience physical intimacy without stress. Slow down and experiment. Once you get the all-clear from the doctor, focus on joy and spontaneity with your wife, pressure-free.",
"Assuming there are no medical explanations, many men I've worked with on this see it as a form of anxiety. The Yerkes-Dodson Law suggests that either too much or too little stress can negatively impact our ability to perform tasks. The ideal amount of stress is in the middle. This applies to many situations, including sexual intimacy. A helpful suggestion is to have open, honest conversations with your partner about this issue, and for a period, agree to explore physical intimacy and sexual pleasure in other forms without the expectation of intercourse. This can renew physical bonding and help reduce anxiety, eventually leading back to the intimacy that may have become elusive."

"responses": [
"It's fun to ride the roller coaster from time to time, isn't it? :) But, it's also weary-making and leads to drainage that no man or woman can hardly anticipate! Balance comes with proper understanding of the different bodies you possess and how they function. To begin, we focus on your physical body and move right up the ladder to the spiritual, starting by cleaning you out. Unbalance is an experience of blocked energies that should be naturally flowing (call them what thou mayest); when blockages are removed, what is naturally there flows, and flows beautifully.",
"Are you certain your highs and lows are directly related to your cycle? It's possible that there are at least some contributing factors, even if they are due to hormonal fluctuations. For example, at the start of your period, do you feel great, or are you tired and down? Mid-cycle (assuming regular periods), do you find yourself napping or ready to run a race? Either way, what you do with your energy can change how you end up feeling. If you feel cranky and bloated before your period, instead of isolating or eating unhealthy food, try restorative yoga and eating a balanced meal to feel better. Even on high-energy days, don't push yourself too hard. If you're feeling fatigued or stressed, take a step back and focus on your self-care. If these tips don't help, see a doctor to make sure everything is in balance.",
"Depression and PMS symptoms can be so hard to navigate! Looking at this from a holistic standpoint can help you understand why you get these mood swings and what to do to balance yourself emotionally. As a woman, we experience hormonal peaks and dips throughout our cycle, and right before menstruation, we tend to feel down. Bloating and extreme cravings don't help either. Make sure to keep your schedule light and include tools to support you during these times, like essential oils such as lavender for calming and orange for uplifting your mood. Birth control may help to reduce hormone fluctuations, and psychiatric medication like SSRIs can be an option. If you choose medication, consult with your doctor about side effects. Reducing processed sugar intake, exercising, spending time outside, and avoiding caffeine and alcohol can all be beneficial.",
"You may already be living a balanced life because you are aware of your ups and downs due to hormonal changes. Schedule activities around your expected mood swings to avoid adding stress during low-energy times. The hormonal cycle is normal. Opinions vary on whether to take natural, homeopathic supplements or pharmaceutical drugs to even out your mood. Pharmaceuticals may have side effects, so it's important to consider what fits best with your lifestyle. Reflect on what will make you feel successful in managing this issue. Sticking to a system that suits your personality and needs will be more effective than following a one-size-fits-all solution."

"I self-harm, and I stop for awhile. Then when I see something sad or depressing, I automatically want to self-harm."
],
"responses": [
"In a way, self-harm can present somewhat like an addiction. According to new research within the field of neuroscience, there is a valid explanation for this. When a person cuts or uses other forms of self-harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better, and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior. Another way to look at it would be through a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long-term negative consequences. Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, such as sadness or depression. Additionally, find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior. Someone trained in Dialectic Behavior Therapy (DBT) and/or Interpersonal Neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you.",
"Self-harm has a way of becoming a go-to method of coping. When we get stuck using self-harm as a way to deal with and manage emotions, it makes sense that when something serious happens, self-harm will be one of the first things to go through the mind. It is its own kind of addiction. There is a therapy, DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy), which focuses on giving you new tools to get through hard times, understand and manage your emotions, stay present, and deal with relationships. This is one of the most effective interventions for self-harm. If you are interested in DBT, reach out to a local therapist and ask if they practice DBT or can recommend a DBT program. This can help immensely. Self-harm recovery is totally possible, but it is definitely hard work!"

"responses": [
"This can be a difficult situation. Typically, only animals that are specifically trained to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as Service Animals. Even though that can be very helpful, emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same way. You might not be able to make your landlord accommodate you. If possible, you may want to consider a different apartment that is more animal-friendly.",
"At present, the American Disability Association (ADA) only allows protection and guidelines for Service Animals, which fall under a separate distinction from Emotional Support Animals. Emotional support animals are untrained animals (typically pets or other domestic animals) that provide wonderful services to their owners, and there are many benefits to having one. Service animals who are trained to provide specific services for an individual with limitations that make them fall under what the ADA defines as 'disabled' are protected under specific laws, and must be accommodated in public places where the human they serve is present. While it may be beneficial to request that the therapist who 'prescribed' the dog to you write a letter to the apartment manager, it sounds like the manager is aware of ADA guidelines, and the simplest course of action may be to find an alternative residence, if that is a plausible option.",
"Agree with the apartment manager's viewpoint that your disability is not a physical limitation. Ask the manager if they'd accept an explanatory letter from a therapist who is licensed to diagnose emotional disabilities. If the answer is yes, then find a therapist who's willing to cooperate with what you need from them and find out this particular therapist's terms of working with you to compose such a letter. If the manager tells you 'no', then find out who is above this person or entity and find out how to formally introduce your request to the board or apartment owner, or whoever actually is the legal owner of the building."

"Ouch. It's really hard to deal with a spouse that isn't taking you seriously. In this case, I would plan for and schedule a time to talk with him about this. I would tell him that you need about 30 minutes to talk to him with minimal interruptions about something that is important to you. Schedule a time, write notes if you need reminders about what you need to express, and tell him how you feel. Ideally, you would focus more on I-statements instead of telling him what he is doing wrong. For example, 'I feel ignored' vs 'You always ignore me.' By focusing on how you feel, he is less likely to feel attacked and get defensive. Some people go to couples or marriage counseling for help with communication. Chances are there are things that BOTH of you do that hurt your communication. Overall, try to talk to him directly and try not to get defensive. If he continues to say, 'you're always sad,' then stay calm, say 'okay, can you help me understand that more?' or 'That's interesting. Tell me what you see.' Reach out to a couples counselor for more help with communication strategies. Sometimes a 3rd party can help you both see things in a different perspective. Hope this helps!",
"This is so hard. It is hard for someone to understand what depression is without having experienced it themselves. Unfortunately, people without depression sometimes mistake it as feeling sorry for ourselves or just moping around, which is not what depression is at all. Sometimes I think that it is easier for family members to see it as a choice than to admit that someone they love is hurting and they don't know what to do. If he is willing, I wonder if there may be a depression support group in your area such as NAMI or DBSA where he could hear from others living with depression and their families. If not, I wonder if you all might watch a documentary together such as No Kidding Me Too or Call me Crazy. If not that, I've sometimes encouraged folk to just leave some information on depression and how family can help like a pamphlet or handout on a table or around the house. We tend to get curious and read things we find on the table. Wishing you the best!",

I would start by making an appointment to talk with a therapist about your sadness. Meeting with a therapist may help you to learn some tools and strategies that can help you to manage some of the sadness you are feeling. A therapist can also help you to gain some understanding and insight into why you might be experiencing sadness. Depression is not something you have to sit with; therapy can help. Once your husband sees that you are being proactive in addressing your sadness/depression, he will probably be more open to listening to you and supporting you. He might start to have ideas and input on how you two can work together to change some of the situations or things that might be holding you back.",
"Oh dear. From what you write, your husband doesn't have any interest in knowing about you and your sad feelings. Stay clear in understanding that you already did your part by asking him to listen and care about the way you feel. In this example, he told you he doesn't care. It's up to him to open his mind and heart to you. Depending on how motivated you are to continue asking him to hear you, try until you feel satisfied that you've given him enough chances to know who you are. At a certain number of tries at this, you'll either have success or not. Just don't try forever because doing so will increase your depressed feelings."

"It sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and it's hard to understand why. This may sound counter-intuitive, but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic (or even cause us some real problems) because it serves us in some unseen way. A simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance; their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life, and they may even know it, but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using. Now I am not saying that what you describe is an addiction, it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefit. One thing I would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content? I'd also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings. These are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapist.",
"I applaud your courage in asking this question to gain some deeper insight into what is happening in your life. This is one of the most common things that I personally have seen in the population of individuals who suffer from depression. It is often that I notice clients focusing on the negative to the complete dismissal of the positive when they are dealing with depression. It is inspiring that you have noticed this in yourself because many clients are not aware that this is a patterns for them, or are not yet willing to face that depression has become a patterns they cling to. Depression, if dealt with for extended periods of time, can become a way of life, an identity of sorts, that is very difficult to part from. While you desperately desire happiness, who would you be without the depression? Sometimes it is scarier to journey into the unknown (in this case, happiness), than it is to stay in the known, and the oftentimes comfortable space of your depression. Human beings, for the most part, fear and stray away from change in general, especially a change that is so impactful. Allowing yourself to confront the possibility of change as positive with the support of a professional counselor is often extremely helpful."

Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it. You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy. Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same."

"Being a parent can be all-consuming. And there are more societal pressures on mothers to be everything to their children and families. In that effort to be everything (cook, housekeeper, planner, social organizer, teacher, etc), it can be easy to forget about being you. We can certainly acknowledge that becoming a mother likely means giving up or sacrificing parts of yourself for motherhood. There are parts of becoming a mother that can be wonderful and magical, and parts of it that can be just flat out hard. I think it is very important however, for all parents to ask for what they need and to carve out the time to nurture their individuality. This may not only be supportive to you, but it sets a great example for your kids about how to advocate for their needs, and teach them about the depth and interests of their mother."

"Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receive treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations, you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving medication for your symptoms is part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together show the most effective outcome for Depression. The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well-being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey.",
"Certainly, counseling can help. However, there is a caveat, namely, you will need the right counselor with the right approach. This leads to two questions: 1) What are the identifiers for the right counselor, and 2) What is the right approach? 1) What are the identifiers for the right counselor? The right counselor will almost certainly have a lot of experience. He or she will have done a lot of personal work and have an ongoing practice of inner work both on their own and with the support of an experienced therapist. This person will be viewing you as a human being with challenges, not as a diagnostic category. He or she will be willing to work with you over an extended period of time and have experience doing such work. Further, they will be well-versed in approaches that are responsive to you in the moment and overall. The in-depth work will be collaboratively designed in an ongoing way that is responsive to you, the moment, your overall life experience, and their in-the-moment experience. It goes without saying that you will subjectively evaluate the felt sense of connection with this person and the feeling that they are invested in their work with you, value you as a human being, and value the connection. As well, it is crucial that you feel this connection and that your therapist 'gets you.' 2) What is the right approach? As Carl Jung stated, 'When the doctor sits down with the patient he (or she) must drop all theories and learn the theory of this person.' The approach must include a bond between you and your therapist that is in a continuous process of development, attention to pre-verbal imprinting, development of awareness ability, ongoing development of the ability to attend to and stay with inner experience, development of a process orientation, attention to egoic structures that were seeded from the earliest days in the service of perceptions of threats to needs being met, identification of current egoic states and work with these inner selves and their relationship with each other to facilitate movement from developmental points of arrest, increased ability to access and contain non-ordinary states of consciousness, attending to what is, and working with this in the service of moving towards optimal human development. Depression is generally experienced as the system shutting down. Anxiety is a signal that something is wrong. Anxiety is not the problem. It is a sign that there is a problem. The core of these issues is a lack of inner security that is the outcome of insufficient bonding. The work of psychotherapy is to establish an environment and relationship that will facilitate work with the bonding ruptures and re-initiation of the developmental process that stopped at an early stage.",

"From whom do you get anti-depressants? This person should be talking with you to know whether the pills are helping or not. Trust your own instinct that the pills aren't helping you. Pills work differently for everyone and not all people feel better from them. It is also possible the particular pills have lost their effectiveness because after around six to eight months, this usually happens. Try to understand what is depressing you. This is slow work since you may have many theories. Just by addressing your own emotional needs and life structure in a caring and respectful way, may improve your mood so that you'll feel less depressed.",
"You have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so. There are lots of different options nowadays for therapists, as you can see them online or in an office. My biggest tip for you is to use Psychology Today or Counsel Chat to find a therapist. Enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to. Be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have. Many times, therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit.",
"The first step, which you've taken, is actually wanting to talk to someone. It's a great sign that you are seeking to reach out for help. And there are therapists everywhere (there are even therapists online, so you don't have to be that close to them or their office.) There are several sites that I refer people to to begin the process of looking for a therapist. I usually have them start with psychologytoday.com. Once there (there is a therapist directory), you can narrow choices down by ages that they work with, insurance they accept, depression as an issue they focus in, etc. You can also narrow down by therapist's modality, but that can get complicated if you aren't too familiar with the various theoretical approaches. It's important that you find someone that you feel understands your situation. That might mean that they identify an issue you are having in their profile, or on their professional website. But, you should try to meet a couple of different therapists if you aren't quite sure. It can be challenging that first session, but your best (note, not 'THE best') therapist will help you feel comfortable (or as comfortable as possible, given therapy can be uncomfortable especially at first) and understood from the get-go. I have found that asking friends or family for names and recommendations is also a common way to find a therapist, because it can come from a trusted referral source. But remember that we are all different, so what works for one might not always be a good fit. And again, it could take a couple of first sessions with different therapists to know if someone is a good fit (sometimes, it can take a few sessions.) And if there is no one around that can give a name or two, then searching online is quite common and can yield positive results. And try not to give up! Finding a therapist is not easy, but finding a good one for you is extremely rewarding.",

"From the little bit you wrote, my guess is you haven't figured out where and how to lay down your own set of roots. Usually, people who have a university-level education are old enough to work in order to support themselves. Unless you have a medical condition which limits or prevents you from working a full-time job, would you guess that the effort and thought involved in deciding in what professional area and geographic location to look for work, would offer you a way to establish your identity? My suggestion is to pay more attention to your own likes, dislikes, and interests. To know these areas more deeply would define the type of people with whom you identify, have a common interest, and with whom you'd like to socialize. The more you realize who you are, the easier time you'll have to find like-minded others and feel securely at home with them and yourself. Again, if you have a medical disability or condition which prevents employment or easily socializing with other people, then this advice would need to be modified for your specific strengths.",
"For some people, having a sense of belonging takes some time. You mentioned that you have an education and some basic daily needs. I wonder if you may be able to look at your relationship with yourself and what makes you feel happy, safe, and having a sense of accomplishment. If you have those feelings, I wonder how you define trust and who you trust. You say you have a good time with people who are \"supposed to be close,\" so I wonder what keeps them from feeling close. I have also wondered if you have been emotionally hurt in the past, and if so, you may have some protective defenses that you use (maybe on purpose, maybe not) to protect yourself from being hurt again. Remember that this idea comes in degrees where you can be more perfect in certain situations and a little less in others. Being emotionally protected is on a spectrum or continuum, where you can make an infinite amount of adjustments or changes with different people and situations. I also wonder what it is that you want in your \"home,\" and how you define it. Consider giving yourself permission to think about how you would define your perfect home in a world where there were no realistic restrictions (such as money or location). After you have that, consider what parts of that you can have. Perhaps there is a small part that you could make a reality within a week or so. Thank you for reaching out.

If you're in an especially stressful or uncertain time in your life, then the best way through is to understand the tension you feel.

When you said that you are jaded, I'm not sure whether you mean that you are jaded toward someone, something, life in general, or some combination thereof. One of the difficult things about anxiety is that anxiety can lead to more anxiety because of being concerned about having another panic attack. Consider remembering that panic attacks usually only last a few minutes and the reason they don't go away right away is because of the way your brain releases chemicals because some part of your brain is reacting as if you are in danger in some way. As far as finding yourself, you may consider looking at what parts of each day you can control as a way to stay centered. You could also focus on something that makes you feel happy and/or comfortable.

If you are socializing among people whom you don't like, have a job you don't like and your family mistreats you and you mistreat them, for example, then anxiety and depression are an understandable natural result. If you make improvements in your life and relationships, even tiny improvements and even the effort and intention to improve, you may find your anxiety and depression dissipating.

"Depression can look different for everybody. It sounds like your family is worried about you, and they may think this behavior could be a result of depression. It’s very common to have thoughts of doubt about yourself and your abilities, and it may help to open up about those thoughts to people you trust. Developing relationships with friends and family can be very rewarding, but it can take courage to reach out!",
"Based on what you've described, it seems you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression, such as low energy, negative thoughts about yourself, and fluctuating social engagement. I encourage you to seek out a therapist or counselor who can help explore these feelings and determine what kind of support might be most helpful for you. Remember, you're not alone, and there are people who care and want to help!"

"It can be really difficult to feel like anxiety is the only emotion you're experiencing. Anxiety often dominates our mental space, making it hard to connect with other feelings. A helpful step is to identify what triggers your anxiety and explore coping mechanisms such as grounding techniques, mindfulness, or talking to a mental health professional. You deserve support in navigating these overwhelming feelings.",

"Dealing with depression on your own can be a big challenge. While telling someone about your feelings might seem overwhelming, consider small steps like reading helpful books or finding online resources. A great book to start with is 'Feeling Good' by Dr. David Burns for practical advice or 'Radical Acceptance' by Tara Brach for a spiritual perspective. Professional help can provide private and effective support as well.",
